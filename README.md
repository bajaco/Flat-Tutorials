## Flat Tutorials - IN PROGRESS

This is my capstone project for the Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nano-Degree. It is currently in progress and I'm making updates every day. You can see my initial project outline in SPECIFICATION.md

### About

The goal is a tutorials site with a React front-end and a Flask-SQLAlchemy back-end. Users will be allowed to submit tutorials, which moderators will decide whether or not to publish. Tutorials will be marked with tags allowing users to find tutorials suited to their particular technology stack. Flat Tutorials is a dedicated learning resource geared towards individuals that prefer text-based tutorials over video tutorials. Moderation is designed to ensure that quality level is high and tags are uniform.
